# House Price Prediction API using Random Forest and Flask

This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model using Random Forest to predict house prices based on various features from the Ames Housing dataset. The model is then deployed as a REST API using Flask.

## Features

- Trains a Random Forest Regressor to predict house prices.
- Provides an endpoint to get predictions using a JSON input.
- Example `curl` commands provided for testing.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

- Flask
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Joblib

Install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
